/*
Write a program that asks the user for a number N and a choice C. And then give them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of all integers in the range 1 to N (both inclusive).



If C is equal to -
1, then print the sum
2, then print the product
Any other number, then print '-1' (without the quotes)
